# Overview

Various files/directories purpose:

html/                 - Exported HTML copy of the Jupyter Notebook in case you don't want to use Jupyter
notebooks/            - Jupyter notebooks for the bulk of data/analysis and for creating the keyboard GIFs
notebooks/images/     - Animated GIFs used in the Jupyter Notebook
notebooks/wordlists/  - The wordlists used by the Jupyter Notebooks
keywalk.c             - The C version to evaluate wordlists and output the CSVs used by the Jupyter Notebooks
keywalk.py            - Original version I started with to evaluate things, but let's face it: python is slow

## Setting up the python environment

bunzip2 the wordlists and result wordlists:

```
    (jh) [jeremy@devone keywalk]$ find notebooks/wordlists/ -type f -print0 | xargs -0 -i -P 4 bunzip2 {}
```


Roughly create a venv for jupyterhub and use pip3 to install the various necessary packages.  Certainly other python environments might work.

```
    [jeremy@devone ~]$ python -m venv create jh
    [jeremy@devone ~]$ cd jh
    [jeremy@devone jh]$ pip3 install jupyter numpy pandas matplotlib
    Defaulting to user installation because normal site-packages is not writeable
    ...
    [jeremy@devone jh]$ ls
    bin  include  lib  lib64  pyvenv.cfg
    [jeremy@devone jh]$ . bin/activate
    (jh) [jeremy@devone jh]$ jupyter notebook
```


## Processing wordlists

1. Compile the keywalk code:

```
    [jeremy@devone pam_keywalk]$ gcc -O2 keywalk.c -o keywalk
```

2. Process the wordlists (output is standard output so redirect stdout to save to a file):
```
    [jeremy@devone pam_keywalk]$ time ./keywalk wordlists/rockyou.txt  > wordlists/results/rockyou_results
    real	0m14.983s
    user	0m14.869s
    sys	0m0.098s
```


## Questions

**Why a Jupyter Notebook?**

I don't like powerpoint and so I usually export to PDF.  However, in PDF form you will be missing the animated GIFs which loses some of the value here.  Plus when presenting I figured it was better to have the data ready available in case there were questions.


**Would it be better to just generate a wordlist**

It's likely a simple algorithm can be significantly smaller and more accurate that a giant wordlist of keyboard walks (at least from my current analysis).  I'm more then willing to see data to the contrary and change my tune.
